# MNIST Classification with Single Hidden Layer Neural Network

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the classification of the MNIST dataset using a simple Neural Network with only one hidden layer. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), and the task is to classify them correctly.

## Overview

The Jupyter notebook `Assigment.ipynb` provides a step-by-step guide to creating and training a neural network for MNIST classification. The network architecture includes an input layer (flattened 28x28 image pixels), a single hidden layer with customizable parameters, and an output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install jupyter numpy matplotlib
```

And Run by using the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook Assigment.ipynb
```
